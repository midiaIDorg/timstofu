# timstofu

Data structures used to represent timsTOF data and clusters alike.

Principal use-cases:

* Represent a TDF so that it is compatible with (multithreaded) numba.

* Represent frame-scan sorted clusters for simpler clusterings comparisons (events contain the origin).

* Allow for box-extractions of raw data (like for cluster comparisons).
